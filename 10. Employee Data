// A marketing company wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics:

First name
Last name
Age (0...100)
Gender (m or f)
Personal ID number (e.g. 8306112507)
Unique employee number (27560000â€¦27569999)
Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate primitive data types. 
Use descriptive names. Print the data at the console. // 

using System;
using System.Text;

namespace EmployeeData
{
    class EmployeeData
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string Firstname = "Ivan";
            string Lastname = "Shopov";
            sbyte Age = 25;
            char Gender = 'm';
            long PersonalIDNumber = 8306112507;
            int UniqueEmployeeNum = 27560000;
            Console.WriteLine("The following information regarding the Employee data could be found here: 
            \n{0} {1} - {2}{3} \nPID {4} \nUEN {5}", Firstname, Lastname, Age, Gender, PersonalIDNumber, UniqueEmployeeNum);
        }
    }
