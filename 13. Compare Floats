// Write a program that safely compares two floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly by a == b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. 
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than a fixed constant eps. //

class CompareFloatingPointNumbers
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter first number: ");
        double fn = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("Enter second number: ");
        double sn = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        double result = fn - sn;
        Console.WriteLine("The results is:\n" + result);
        float cons = 0.000001f;
        bool checkEqualorNot = (Math.Abs(fn - sn) < cons);
        Console.WriteLine("The statements is: " + checkEqualorNot);
    }
}
