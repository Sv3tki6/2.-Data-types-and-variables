// Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©, something like this:

   ©

  © ©

 ©   ©

© © © ©
Note: The © symbol may be displayed incorrectly at the console so you may need to change the console character encoding to UTF-8 and 
assign a Unicode-friendly font in the console.

Note: Under old versions of Windows the © symbol may still be displayed incorrectly, regardless of how much effort you put to fix it. //
